# Model Imports Generator - ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5) 🧸

## What Does This Do? 🤔

Imagine you have a toy box (your app) with lots of different toys (models). Every time you want to play, you need to find all the toys. 

**The Old Way (Slow):** 
Every time the app starts, it looks through the entire toy box to find all the toys. This takes time! ⏰

**The New Way (Fast):**
Before you even start playing, we make a list of where all the toys are! Now when you want to play, you just read the list instead of searching. Much faster! 🚀

## What is a "Generator"? 🏭

A generator is like a helper robot 🤖 that:
1. Looks at all your toy boxes (model files)
2. Finds which ones have the toys you need (Model classes)
3. Makes a list of them (generates a file)

This list is saved, so next time you don't need to search again!

## How to Run the Generator 🏃‍♂️

### Option 1: Run it manually (for testing)

```bash
# From the project root directory
python generators/generate_model_imports.py
```

You'll see something like:
```
Static Model Imports Generator
==================================================
Project root: /your/project/path
Models directory: /your/project/path/src/database/models
Output file: /your/project/path/src/database/generated_models_imports.py

✓ Generated /your/project/path/src/database/generated_models_imports.py
  - Found 4 module(s) with Model subclasses
    • src.database.models.empresa
    • src.database.models.equipamento
    • src.database.models.manutencao_equipamento
    • src.database.models.sensor

✓ Generation complete!
```

### Option 2: It runs automatically! ✨

When you build the Docker image, the generator runs **automatically**! 

Look in the Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
COPY generators/generate_model_imports.py /app/generators/generate_model_imports.py
RUN python /app/generators/generate_model_imports.py
```

This means:
- Every time you build the app → generator runs
- The list is always up-to-date
- Your app starts faster! 

## What Files Are Involved? 📁

### Input Files (What the generator reads):
- `src/database/models/*.py` - All your model files (the toy boxes)

### Generator File (The robot that does the work):
- `generators/generate_model_imports.py` - The generator script

### Output File (The list that gets created):
- `src/database/generated_models_imports.py` - The generated list of imports

## How Does It Work? 🔍

1. **Scan**: The generator looks at every `.py` file in `src/database/models/`
2. **Detect**: It checks if the file has a class that inherits from `Model`
   - It does this using AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) - like reading the code without running it
3. **Generate**: It creates a new file with import statements for all the models found
4. **Save**: The file is saved as `generated_models_imports.py`

## Example of What Gets Generated 📝

If you have these model files:
- `empresa.py` (has `class Empresa(Model)`)
- `sensor.py` (has `class Sensor(Model)`)
- `utils.py` (just helper functions, no Model)

The generator creates:
```python
# AUTOGENERATED FILE - DO NOT EDIT
# Generated by generators/generate_model_imports.py

import importlib
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def import_generated_models() -> None:
    """Import all modules that contain Model subclasses."""
    # Importing 2 model module(s)
    try:
        importlib.import_module("src.database.models.empresa")
    except ImportError as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to import src.database.models.empresa: {e}")
    try:
        importlib.import_module("src.database.models.sensor")
    except ImportError as e:
        logger.error(f"Failed to import src.database.models.sensor: {e}")
```

Notice that `utils.py` is NOT included because it doesn't have a Model class!

## When Should I Run It? ⏰

**You usually don't need to!** It runs automatically during Docker build.

But you might want to run it manually if:
- ✅ You added a new model and want to test it works
- ✅ You're debugging import issues
- ✅ You want to see what models will be imported

## Troubleshooting 🔧

### "No models found!"
- Check that your model files are in `src/database/models/`
- Make sure your classes inherit from `Model`
- Check for syntax errors in your model files

### "Import failed!"
- Check that the generated file exists: `src/database/generated_models_imports.py`
- Try running the generator manually to see errors
- Check the logs for specific import errors

### "Generator won't run!"
- Make sure you're in the project root directory
- Check that Python can find the `src` package
- Try: `python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.'); from generators.generate_model_imports import *"`

## What's the Magic? ✨

The "magic" is that instead of finding models every single time your app starts (slow), we find them once when building the Docker image (fast)!

Think of it like:
- **Old way**: Look through the whole library every time you want a book 📚😰
- **New way**: Use the library catalog that lists all books 📖😊

## Where to Learn More? 📚

- Read the code: `generators/generate_model_imports.py` (it has comments!)
- Check the tests: `tests/test_code_generator.py` (shows how it works)
- Look at what it creates: `src/database/generated_models_imports.py`
